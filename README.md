# Todo-WebApp
A simple and intuitive To-Do application built with React. This app allows users to add, check/uncheck, and delete tasks, helping them manage their daily activities efficiently. The app also persists your tasks using localStorage, so your to-do list is saved even if you refresh the page or close your browser.
